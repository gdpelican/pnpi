 1. This field can be filled out using Markdown, which is a markup language that lets you write some simple formatted HTML, without having to learn (too much) pesky coding stuff.
    
    Some examples:
      
    * Single asterisks (\\*italic\\*) makes text *italic*
    * Double asterisks (\\*\\*bold\\\*\\*) makes text **bold**
    * \\[A link\\](http://www.google.com) turns into [A link](http://www.google.com)

    If you're not, more power to you! Markdown will accept plain text just fine as well.
      
    Happy typing!"
